## INTRODUCTION

In 1990's, with the introduction of web application has changed the way of life we lived before. The digital era has been started from 1990's to present and it goes on with never stopping energy but the developing of any web application at that time is huge and complex. As we remember the static page application where we have to update every single content manually and then deploy it to the server each and every time which increases developers complexity and cost. so then came dynamic web application which reduces the complexity of developer but the cost was remain same as before because of the heavy load in the server side.
Finally with the help of restfull web service and Client side MVC (Model View Controll) Framework eg. BackboneJs, AngularJS, KnockoutJs. The development of web application become so easy and fast. 

- How angularJs change the world of web application?

        AngularJs is a client side MV* (Model View Whatever) javascript Framework. You can use any term instead 
        of  whatever eg. (Controller, Presenter, ViewModel). The most popular functionality of AngularJs is to 
        provide two way data binding.

- What do you mean by Two-Way Data binding?

        Two-way data binding is to update the data/information to the view whenever any data change in model 
        or vice-versa.

        eg. ng-model in angularJs is used to provide two-way data binding.
